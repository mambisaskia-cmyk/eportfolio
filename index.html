        <h2>What is Period Underwear?</h2>
        <p>
            Period underwear is a type of specially designed underwear that absorbs menstrual flow, allowing women to feel confident and comfortable throughout their day without needing disposable pads or tampons. These underwear are made with layers of absorbent and leak-proof materials that can hold menstrual blood while still being breathable and stylish. They are designed to be worn for up to 6 hours at a time and should be changed regularly for hygiene. Unlike single-use products, period underwear can be washed and reused, making it both convenient and environmentally friendly. They are suitable for daily wear, exercise, school, work, or even sleep, giving women the freedom to move without worry.

        <h2>Why Choose Period Underwear?</h2>
        <p>
            Period underwear offers many benefits that make it a better choice compared to traditional menstrual products. First, it is eco-friendly because it can be reused hundreds of times, reducing the mountains of waste that come from disposable pads and tampons. This makes it an excellent choice for anyone concerned about the environment. Second, it is highly comfortable, as it does not require bulky pads that can shift, cause discomfort, or create awkward lines under clothing. Third, it is cost-effective because it can replace disposable products and save money over time. Additionally, period underwear is designed to keep you feeling clean and dry for up to 6 hours, after which it should be changed to maintain proper hygiene. Overall, it is a safe, sustainable, and practical option for managing periods while supporting women’s confidence and well-being.

        <h2>Why I Designed Period Underwear</h2>
        <p>
            I decided to design period underwear because I am a girl with a high-flow period and have personally experienced the challenges of managing heavy menstrual flow. Growing up, I often faced leaks, discomfort, and anxiety during school or daily activities, and traditional pads and tampons never fully met my needs. I wanted a solution that would allow girls like me to feel confident, comfortable, and secure without worrying about accidents or interruptions to our daily lives. Designing reusable period underwear was my way of creating a product that is both practical and empowering for women. I also wanted to contribute to environmental sustainability by reducing menstrual waste, which is a huge problem globally. By making a product that is washable, reusable, and effective, I aim to make periods a simpler and more dignified experience for girls and women everywhere.
